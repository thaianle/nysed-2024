# NYSED School Report Card Project

## Description of the project (Updated June 4, 2025)

An ongoing data analysis project using PostgreSQL, using the [2023-24 School Report Card Database](https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php) from the New York State Education Department (NYSED).

The raw database and README files, directly downloaded from the NYSED website in May 2025, is stored in the [data](https://github.com/thaianle/nysed-2024/tree/main/data) folder.

The database was originally a Microsoft Access database (.accdb), and I migrated it to PostgreSQL using the "Export ODBC" function.

Here, you can see my [source code](https://github.com/thaianle/nysed-2024/blob/main/analysis.sql) as a SQL file, and another [Markdown file](https://github.com/thaianle/nysed-2024/blob/main/analysis.md) acting as a "notebook", containing both the code and its interpretation.
